<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Armaan Patel and I am a freshman in highschool. I have been coding for a few months now and I have made quite a few fun games. I am learning coding through BYJU's which is an organization that teaches kids and yound-adults how to code among other things. </p>
<p>This page is a portfolio with some of the games I have created so far in my coding career. Some of these games include Epic Archery, a treasure collecting game, and Fruit Ninja. </p>
